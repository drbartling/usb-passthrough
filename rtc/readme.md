# Button Press Example

Example sharing small state between two tasks, where one task writes the state,
and the other task reads the state.

## About

I wanted to show a small example of sharing small state values between tasks.
I'd say it's generally a good idea to only have one task update a value, while
allowing multiple taskt to read from it.
